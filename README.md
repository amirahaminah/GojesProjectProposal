# CalorieTracker

### 1.1 INTRODUCTION
The application that we are going to develop is mobile application and the name is given as Calorie Tracker. The target users of this system is public people and for those who concern about their health especially daily calorie intake. We plan to do several functions such as scan the food calories, calculate the user’s calorie intake and calculate the calorie burns by pedometer. More details will be explain in this proposal below.

### 1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
#### 1.2.1  Background of the problem
 
The system intended to be developed is a mobile application while the target users will be men and women who are concern with their calories intake and burnt. Normally, when people take their meal, they are unaware of the calorie intakes. This can be detrimental because ones might take too much calories while ones might consume too little calories for their body. Moreover, the calories intake for each individual is different according to some factors for instance age, gender, weight and exercise level.

#### 1.2.2 Problem Statement 
Sometimes it is hard to locate the calories of food products due to too many information on the products’ cover/ packaging/ plastic and the font used can be too small to read. The information provided on the foods’ packaging does not include how many calories intake is suitable for each individual. It takes time to calculate manually the number of calories needed and burned for each person.

### 1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop a mobile application that help users to have a healthy lifestyle by providing some functions such as counting the amount of calories intake and burned. Apart from that, the application is intended to ease the users to know the number of calories of a particular food in a more convenient way, which is by scanning the barcode. Generally, the apps to be developed will be a simple apps with minimalist design, easy to use and small in storage. The report that will be produced is the Final Project Report.

### 1.4 PROJECT SCOPE
#### 1.4.1 Scope
Calorie Tracker is a system that will help its user to use a mobile application in order to track the calorie intake and calorie burned in a day.

#### 1.4.2 Targeted User
The application is developed to assist men and women who are concerned about eating healthy, loves exercising and also those who want to lose weight as this application will help to monitor the calorie intake as well as calorie burned in a day. 

#### 1.4.3 Specific Platform
In developing Calorie Tracker, Android platform will be used in order to develop this project and Visual Studio Code from Microsoft for the tools as it is a free tools for developers, ES6 react-native, expo app and node.js

### 1.5 CONSTRAINTS
The constraints in developing this application will be limited machine because some of the team members use native code with emulator while the others are using expo app. Besides, other constraints will be skills in creating every function and combining them into one app.

### 1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT

The significance of Calorie Tracker will benefit:
- Males or females who want to keep track of their calories this portable mobile application.
- People who want to know the total number of calories for a specific food or the food they will consume.
- Making life easier or the people who wants to know how many calories burned in each day.
- Give concern and awareness to the people about their healthy lifestyle.

### 1.8 SUMMARY
In conclusion, the Calorie Tracker is an app to help the user maintain a healthy lifestyle by monitoring their calorie intake and calorie burned. The current process of calorie tracking is confusing and hard to understand for them. Based on the problem, we are aiming to develop a proper platform for the user to calculate and observe their daily calorie intake. Not only that, the targeted users and platform to develop this app is also stated with the project stages to plan and keep track on our progress. We hope this project will become successful and useful for the targeted user.
